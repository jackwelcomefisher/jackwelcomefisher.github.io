Welcome to my website, my name is Jack. I am an economics PhD candidate at the London School of Economics. Happy to have passed through the University of York, University of Oxford, and University of California, Berkeley on the way.

My research aims to better understand the gig economy by using insights from industrial organization, labor economics, and public finance. More broadly, I am interested in alternative work arrangements and labor market power. I also study some topics in household finance.

I am on the job market in 2022-23 and will be available for interviews remotely, as well as in person at the EJM and the ASSA.

Please feel free to reach out by email: [J.W.Fisher@lse.ac.uk](mailto:J.W.Fisher@lse.ac.uk).

My CV is available [here](https://jackwelcomefisher.github.io/Fisher_JM_CV_current.pdf).
