# Jack Fisher

Welcome to my website, my name is Jack Fisher. I am an economics PhD candidate at the London School of Economics. Happy to have passed through the University of York, University of Oxford, and University of California, Berkeley on the way.

My research aims to better understand the gig economy by using insights from industrial organization, labor economics, and behavioral economics. More broadly, I am interested in alternative work arrangements and labor market power. I also study some topics in household finance and enjoy teaching public economics.
