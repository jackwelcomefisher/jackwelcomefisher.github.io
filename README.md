Welcome to my website, my name is Jack. I am an economics PhD candidate at the London School of Economics. Happy to have passed through the University of York, University of Oxford, and University of California, Berkeley on the way.

My research aims to better understand the gig economy by using insights from applied microeconomics. More broadly, I am interested in how technology shapes labor markets. I also study some topics in household and public finance.

<!--- I am on the job market in 2022-23 and will be available for interviews remotely, as well as in person at the EJM and the ASSA. -->

I will join the [Platform Lab](https://d3.harvard.edu/labs/platform-lab/) at Harvard's D^3 Institute in fall 2023 as a postdoctoral fellow, before joining the University of Virginia's [economics department](https://economics.virginia.edu/) in summer 2024 as an assistant professor. In the meantime, I am excited to intern at [Uber](https://www.uber.com/us/en/careers/teams/data-science/?_csid=vD1cFdrDB0NlxFRfiJtHmg&state=0zIp32pXknmcFSDAukbz_qbGpaC-hKpwHSHfd2-xiuU%3D&effect=) as an applied scientist.
